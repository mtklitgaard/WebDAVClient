# WebDAVClient

## Abount

Strongly-typed, async WebDAV Client implementation in C# broken out and tested. Also includes the ability to upload multiple files and directories.

WebDAVClient is based originally on <https://github.com/kvdb/WebDAVClient>. I've added Async support (instead of Callback), as well strong-types responses.
